    <h1>Overlaid the jeepers uselessly twice</h1>
    <p>Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries
        Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated
        they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics,
        a large language ocean. A small river named Duden flows by their
        place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia. <a href="https://www.google.com/?safe=active&ssui=on">Selengkapnya (link google)</a></p>

    <h2>On deer horse aboard tritely yikes and much</h1>
    <p>The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands
        of bad Commas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the
        Little Blind Text didn’t listen. She packed her seven versalia, put
        her initial into the belt and made herself on the way.</p>
    <p>When she reached the first hills of the Italic Mountains, she had a
        last view back on the skyline of her hometown Bookmarksgrove, the
        headline of <span style="color: #A100FF; font-weight: bold;">Alphabet Village</span> and the subline of her own road, the
        Line Lane. Pityful a rethoric question ran over her cheek, then she
        continued her way. On her way she met a copy. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/">Selengkapnya (link youtube)</a></p>

    <h3>Overlaid the jeepers uselessly much excluding</h1>
    <p>But nothing the copy said could convince her and so it didn’t take
        long until a few insidious Copy Writers ambushed her, made her drunk
        with <span style="color: #390FFF; font-weight: bold;">Longe and Parole</span> and dragged her into their agency, where they
        abused her for their projects again and again. And if she hasn’t been
        rewritten, then they are still using her.</p>
    <p>It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly
        into your mouth. Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about
        the blind texts it is an almost unorthographic life One day however a
        small line of blind text by the name of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave
        for the far World of Grammar. <a href="about.html">Selengkapnya (internal link)</a> </p>

    <h6>Slapped cozy a that lightheartedly and far</h1>
    <p>The copy warned the <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">Little Blind Text</span>, that where it came from it would have
        been rewritten a thousand times and everything that was left from its origin
        would be the word "and" and the Little Blind Text should turn around and return
        to its own, safe country.</p>
